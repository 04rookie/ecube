# Files

**/Server.js** handles all the requests from front-end. **/app/** contains the static build of the front-end. **/Client/** contains the development files of front-end.


# Deployment
The Server and Build is deployed on **Heroku**. The server stores and retrieves data from a database setup in MongoDB Atlas.

# Libraries 
- **Express**- Express package allows us to define routes for our API. The project aims at being 100% RESTful for better scalability and standards.
- **Mongoose**- Instead of using direct MongoDB library, this project uses Mongoose package. It makes the code concise, clear, quick and simple. It removes a lot of boiler plate, which makes the code more readable. 
- **jsonwebtoken**- For authentication and access the project uses JWT in header for every call and verifies the request.
- **React**- The React framework makes the website standardized, efficient DOM changes, and responsive. It makes the state management with help of hooks very simple and effective.
- **Material-UI**- The abundant library provides various components like Grid, Box, Stack, Buttons, Views, Paper and many more that are flexible and easy to customize for personal use. 
- **Axios**- An excellent and easy to use library that allows front-end to communicate with the Server API.
- **React-Router-Dom**- Manages the client side routing for the project and switches the components.
- **Font-Awesome**- Provides rich icons for the project.
